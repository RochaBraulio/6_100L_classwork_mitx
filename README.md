# 6_100L_classwork_mitx
# Description
This repo stores classwork from MITx course 6.100L (Intro. to CS &amp; programming using Python).
I'm not officially enrolled on this course, but I use it on my self-taught journey to learn Python.

# Retrieval Practice
If you are also taking this course and want to study more efficiently, by using retrieval practice (know more [here](https://www.brainscape.com/academy/multiple-choice-active-passive-studying/)ðŸ‘ˆ), I created this [deck](https://www.brainscape.com/p/362NO-LH-DF5CZ) in Brainscape for quizzing myself. Feel free to use it and suggest improvements.
